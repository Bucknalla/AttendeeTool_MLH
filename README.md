# AttendeeTool

A quick simple python tool built on RUMPS to enable hackathon organisers to quickly see the attendees at their event. It also collates any commonly used resources like the code of conduct and sanction guide.

This tool works using MLH's API (my.mlh.io) to query users and provide organiser support. It's an easy way to get important information about attendees.
